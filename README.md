# Cryptid Sound Board

## Description

A fun side project I created to get more familiar with React Hooks and the Stylized-Components library. 

Site is highly responsive and infinitely scalable.

Will add additional sounds/cryptids when I find inspiration. Sounds sourced from https://freesound.org/
